# Stage 1: Build the application using Maven
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy as builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy Maven wrapper and pom.xml files from the current context inside the app directory
COPY .mvn/ .mvn
COPY mvnw pom.xml ./

# Grant execute permissions to the Maven wrapper
RUN chmod +x ./mvnw

# Resolve dependencies (cache this step for faster future builds)
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline

# Copy the source code into the container
COPY src ./src

# Compile and package the application (creates a JAR file in /target directory)
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Run the application (without Maven)
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the JAR from the build stage to the runtime stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Command to run the Spring Boot application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
